## Item 1: Autocomplete The Location Name (Phase 1):
The purpose of this function is that whenever a user enters an incomplete name of a location, the program should output possible location names.

Example:\
Input: "Chi"\

## Item 3: Get All Categories (Phase 2):
This function returns all attributes listed in data (no duplicates).

Obtained output:

<p align="center"><img src="images/Item 3 Get all categories.png" alt="Nearby" width="500"/></p>

## Item 6: CalculateShortestPath between two places (Phase 2):

Given two input locations, this function finds the best (shortest) route from one location to another using Dijkstra & Bellman Ford algorithm.

Obtained Output:

<p align="center"><img src="images/Item 6 Dijsktra and Bellman Ford.png" alt="Nearby" width="500"/></p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/Item 6 Map.png" alt="Nearby" width="500"/></p>

From obtained output, it can be observed that Dijkstra takes lesser time compared to Bellman Ford. This is because Bellman Ford handles a wide range of scenarios.

## Item 9: The Traveling Trojan Problem (AKA Traveling Salesman!) (Phase 3):

This function finds the shortest route that covers all the locations & returns back to the starting point. Weâ€™ve used Brute-Force, Brute-force enhanced with early backtracking  and 2-opt algorithm.

Obtained Output:

<p align="center"><img src="images/Item 9 Six Points.png" alt="Nearby" width="500"/></p>

Time comparison:

|  6  |  0  | 0 | 0 |
|  7  |  16  | 6 | 0 |
|  12  |  time limit exceed  | ~ | ~ |


Runtime for algorithm:

    ->Brute Force: O(n!)
    ->Backtracking: O((n-1)!) 
    ->2-opt: O((n^2)*i), where n = locations to be visited, i = iterations
    ->Time spent: In 2-opt & backtracking, we encountered a bug that we were not counting distance by including first node as last one. Majority of the time from entire project was spent on these three functions.

## Item 10: Find Nearby

Given an attribute name `C`, a location name `L` and a number `r` and `k`, the app finds at most `k` locations in attribute `C` on the map near `L` with the range of `r` and return a vector of string ids. 

The order of locations are from nearest to farthest.

## Item 12: Check the existence of the path with a constrained gas tank (Phase 3):

This function receives an input vector which has a pair of source & destination locations & gas tank capacity. Given this information, the function finds if there is a way to travel from source to destination with a given tank size, considering that we can refuel at any node.

Obtained output:

<p align="center"><img src="images/Item 12 Gas Tank.png" alt="Nearby" width="500"/></p>

     ->Runtime of algorithm: O(n*(V+E)), n = number of queries
     ->Time spent: Fairly less

By using data structures & algorithms learned through EE538, We have implemented an algorithm that can be used in any geo-spatial application for basic queries like search a location, find shortest from one location to another location & many other queries.
